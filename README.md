# LittleWeeb

LittleWeeb is a IRC XDCC Client Purely made for downloading anime. It features a simple design made to function and nothing more. It's free, it will always be free, and will never contain Ads or anything that makes you think about giving us money. Since this whole project is voluntary, meant to be voluntary, meant to be non-profit, we, as developers of LittleWeeb, will never start asking for donations of the sorts.

### Tech
LittleWeeb uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

**Desktop Clients:**
* [Electron](https://electronjs.org/)

**Android:**
* [Xamarin.Android + WebView](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/android/)

**Interface:**
* [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/)- A slick looking CSS Framework.
* [jQuery] - unfortunately, semantic ui has a very limited angular implementation which didn't suit the needs for this application.
* [NIBL API](https://api.nibl.co.uk:8080/swagger-ui.html) - Thanks to nibl.co.uk API and the developer [Jenga201](https://github.com/jenga201) from NIBL to provide me the api and help that I need!
* [Kitsu API](https://kitsu.docs.apiary.io/) - To replace anilists api.

**Backend:**
* Custom in-house [SimpleWebSocketServer](https://github.com/EldinZenderink/SimpleWebSocketServer) - I could use an excisting one... . 
* Custom in-house [SimpleIRCLib](https://github.com/EldinZenderink/SimpleIRCLib) - Why are there no other DCC supported IRC Client libraries out there?.
* [Json.NET](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) - Well... obviously.

### Installation Desktop Clients

* On linux, the default download directory and directory for storing the configuration & log files is the same as where the AppImage is launched, make sure to **not** launch LittleWeeb from a directory which requires root permission!

### Development

This application is still in development, contains many issues, which I haven't found yet. Since I am doing the grunt of the development, and the front-end is handled by Daniel-Law, the progress is slow. Furthermore, we are doing it in our free-time and mine is just about to run out. Therefore I cannot work on major releases and will only be fixing issues with the current version. App breaking bugs and issues will be solved first and minor issues will be solved lateron. 

### What can you do?

This application is made with love, for them weebs. But with just the two of us working on LittleWeeb, we can't do that much in the short time limited that we call free time. Therefore, I would humbly ask any LittleWeeb users to help us and eachother out when using LittleWeeb.
